# sparkfirebot
**sparkfirebot is a multipurpose bot experiment.**

# What happened to this repository?
- I have taken it down because the bot kept getting stolen without credit

# Is the bots code somewhere else?
- Snippets of the bot's code are throughout the @sparkfirebot organization.


This is to prevent code getting completely ripped off, but to allow other developers to learn and expand their bots(?) from them. If you are skilled enough to put it together, then you may as well have a free bot.
